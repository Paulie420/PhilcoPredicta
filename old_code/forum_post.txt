I'm always too long-winded... heres a tiny synopsis ; I don't KNOW Python but 
have been able to Google search enough to cobble together a half-solution. I 
want to bring new life to antique (and vintage) televisions. I have a 1946 
Philco Predicta TV, fully refurbished, paired w/ a Raspberry Pi Zero and a 
capacitive touch sensor. I have all 1920-1950 videos collected; 128GB or so! 
When TV (and Pi) is turned on, Pi starts randomly displaying videos in a 
/folder or -USB stick. If user presses capacitive touch button, kill current 
video and goto next.

Some current issues: If a video ENDS, another random video doesn't start 
automatically - I HAVE to press the button. I don't know the 'smartest' way to 
load my software. Currently, it displays using omxplayer to the tty1/TV... I 
need to learn how to test for omxplayer ENDING, and starting another random 
video...

One thing I want to add now - I have a secondary /sub-directory called 
'commercials'. I'd like 1-2 commercials to play after either every 3rd random 
video, OR if I can code in that 1-2 play after every 15minutes, regardless of 
how many random videos have played.

One thing I want to add LATER, and don't exactly know how - I have an antique 
remote control that I want to stuff with an Arduino. It only has four buttons, 
but would be so cool if power turned the system off, channel up/down cycled to 
a new random video and ... some other function for the 4th button; but I dunno 
how the Pi will recieve that data, and this is for later...

```
pi@Predicta:~ $ cat predicta.py
#!/usr/bin/python

import time
import os
import random
from gpiozero import Button
from signal import pause
from contextlib import contextmanager
import sys

buttonPin = 21
directory = "/home/pi/Videos/"

u/contextmanager
def suppress_stdout():
with open(os.devnull, "w") as devnull:
old_stdout = sys.stdout
sys.stdout = devnull
try:
yield
finally:
sys.stdout = old_stdout
def playEpisode():
with suppress_stdout():
episode = random.choice(os.listdir(directory))

#Must figure out; do we want --aspect-mode stretch or NOT. on Predicta...
cmd = "nohup omxplayer --aspect-mode stretch "+"'"+directory+episode+"' &"
# cmd = "nohup omxplayer "+"'"+directory+episode+"' &"

os.system('sudo killall omxplayer.bin')
os.system('sudo killall omxplayer')
os.system(cmd)

# the following DOESNT work to keep playing MORE videos after one ends...
# currently, it waits for another buttonpress. i want more to play if no
# buttonpress. :/
# playEpisode()

#Below does play random videos one after another, from a LIST - but doesnt
#allow for button presses; omxplayer continues.... grrrrr. 5/30/22
#def playEpisode():
# videoList = os.listdir(directory)
# random.shuffle(videoList)
# for video in videoList:
# target = os.path.join(directory, video)
# os.system('omxplayer "{}" > /dev/null'.format(target))

playEpisode()
button = Button(buttonPin)
button.when_released = playEpisode
pause()

```

Here is my very limited code, and I hope a couple folks might want to help out. 
I want to learn Python more and open-source this project so every antique 
store, or vintage TV owner, can pop a USB stick in and breathe new life into 
TVs that are almost useless.
