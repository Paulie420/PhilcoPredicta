#These were from an OLD install of Raspberry Pi OS; I've since updated
#to Raspberry Pi OS Legacy - don't know if pulseaudio is still used.

To get bluetoothctl to connect with bluetooth speaker, i had to 
pulseaudio -k
and
pulseaudio -start
(or pulseaudio start)?? had to kill and restart pulseaudio.

in bluetoothctl you have to:

pair item
trust item
connect item <--- this one was giving me issues...

using bluez to do it.

omxplayer has to have the -o alsa command to pass audio to bluetooth
speaker...

however, when i changed the omxplayer command in the python script, only
the first video would have good sound. is it because how i kill the omx
program? is it because of using nohup? i'll have to figure that out, but
it sounded great - and looked great. :/

would it be easier to simply run some kind of 3.5mm audio? or, figure
out all the ways you CAN send audio from a pi zero. theres no 3.5mm jack
so how else would you get audio out? check all the ways, and pick the 
best fit for this project. using some external speakers, however, IS the
way to go.
